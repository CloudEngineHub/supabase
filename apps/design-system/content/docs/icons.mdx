## Principles

1. Paired: Icons should accompany text, as they aren’t often obvious enough on their own.
2. Clear: Icons should be legible at small sizes and unembellished. Let the text do the heavy lifting.
3. Consistent: Use the same icons for similar actions throughout Supabase. This makes the app easier to use.

## Tints

Use classes just like you would for text to tint icons. For example, `text-foreground-muted`.

Destructive actions, such as deleting an API key, don’t need to be [tinted](color-usage#text) with `text-destructive` because there should be a confirmation dialog as a failsafe right after.

## UI Icons

We rely on Lucide icons for most of our UI icons.

## Custom Icons

Tap on an icon below to copy the JSX, SVG, or import path.

### Adding New Custom Icons

To add a new custom icon to the Supabase icon library:

1. **Create SVG file**: Add your SVG file to `packages/icons/src/raw-icons/` with a kebab-case name (e.g., `my-new-icon.svg`)

2. **SVG Requirements**:

   - Export as 24x24px with viewBox="0 0 24 24"
   - Use `stroke="currentColor"` for strokes (no hardcoded colors)
   - Use `fill="none"` for fills (no hardcoded colors)
   - Keep icon content around 18x18px within the 24x24 frame
   - Remove unnecessary elements like `<clipPath>`, `<defs>`, and `<g>` wrappers
   - Keep SVG structure simple with just `<path>` elements

You don't need to change SVG attributes to suit React. Just leave attributes like `stroke-width` as they are, not camel-cased.

3. **Build the component**: Run `npm run build:icons` in the `packages/icons` directory

4. **Use the icon**: Import and use like any other icon:

   ```jsx
   import { MyNewIcon } from 'icons'
   ;<MyNewIcon size={16} strokeWidth={1} />
   ```

   **Default props**: Icons have `strokeWidth={2}` and `size={24}` by default. You can override these as needed.

### Troubleshooting

**Build errors**: If you encounter JSON import errors, remove any `.json` files from `packages/icons/src/raw-icons/` - they're optional and can cause build issues.
